    <p>
        Hey, my name is Raul Chakraborty. I am a junior at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management and
        Technology with a concentration in Data Analytics and Web Design Management with I am looking to add a minor in
        Computer Science and Economics. My interests are in large scale systems and how to design and implement large
        scale enterprise systems. I am also interested in financial and real estate markets hence why I am also looking
        to add a minor in Economics. I have worked as a Junior Web Developer for Syracuse University Communications and
        Marketing and picked up a lot of skills in backend web development and skills in DevOps. Outside of school, I
        love playing and watching soccer, my favorite show is The Office and I have two annoying younger brothers.
